# Evenly distribute x into a rectangle

```bash
# Finds the closest pair of numbers that when multiplied equal the given number.
# The biggest of the 2 will always be first
# The worst case scenario is that the second number is 1
# Anything that cannot be parsed as a positive integer throws an error
